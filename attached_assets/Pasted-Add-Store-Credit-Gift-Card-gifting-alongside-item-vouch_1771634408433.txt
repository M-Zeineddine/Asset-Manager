Add “Store Credit / Gift Card” gifting alongside item vouchers.

REQUIREMENT
Support two gift types:
- ITEM: existing gift_products flow
- CREDIT: money amount usable on anything at a specific merchant
Receiver ONLY shows QR/code. ONLY merchant portal (logged-in staff) can redeem and mark REDEEMED.

DATA MODEL
Update gift_orders:
- giftType: "ITEM" | "CREDIT" (default "ITEM")
- creditAmount: number (required when giftType="CREDIT")
- productRef/productId nullable when CREDIT
- Keep: merchantRef/merchantId, amount, currency, giftToken, redeemCode, qrPayload, status, timestamps
For CREDIT, set amount = creditAmount.

UI CHANGES
1) Merchant page:
- Add a new section or tab “Store Credit” above the items list.
- Show preset buttons (LBP 500,000 / 1,000,000 / 2,000,000) + “Custom amount”.
- Selecting an amount navigates to GiftCustomize with {giftType:"CREDIT", merchantId, creditAmount}.

2) Gift Customize page:
- If giftType="CREDIT", show editable amount selector (preset pills + custom input) in the summary card.
- Keep existing fields (senderName, message required, theme, delivery channel, receiver contact, schedule).

3) Checkout:
- Display summary as “Store Credit at {Merchant} – LBP X”.
- On “Pay (Mock)”, call backend createGiftOrder with giftType="CREDIT" and creditAmount.
- Success share link unchanged.

4) Receiver Gift page:
- If CREDIT, show “Store Credit” + “LBP X credit” + instruction “Apply to your bill”.
- QR/code display unchanged.

5) Merchant Portal:
- When redeeming a CREDIT gift, show giftType + creditAmount and mark REDEEMED.
- MVP rule: one-time full use (no remaining balance / partial redemption).

BACKEND
Update Cloud Function(s):
- createGiftOrder: accept giftType and creditAmount; validate:
  - CREDIT: creditAmount>0 and merchant exists
  - ITEM: product exists and belongs to merchant
Generate giftToken + redeemCode server-side as before.
Store qrPayload including giftType and amount.
- getGiftPublic: return safe fields including giftType and creditAmount.
- redeemGift: no changes except show/return giftType and amount; still transactional + prevents double redemption.

SECURITY
Update Firestore rules/types accordingly (no client-side write to redeemed fields; redemption via Cloud Function only).

TESTS / DEMO
- Add demo preset amounts and ensure end-to-end:
  create CREDIT gift -> open /g/:orderId?t=token -> merchant redeem -> status becomes REDEEMED -> receiver shows redeemed state.
Do not refactor unrelated code; implement minimal changes cleanly.
